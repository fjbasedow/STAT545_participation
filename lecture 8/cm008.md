STAT 545 Class Meeting 08
================

Today's Lessons
---------------

Today's topic is *one-table verbs with `dplyr`*. We've already seen `select`, `filter`, and `arrange`.

-   mutate
-   grouped summarize
-   grouped mutate

...and their corresponding theoretical function types.

Resources
---------

Concepts from today's class are closely mirrored by the following resources.

-   Jenny's tutorial on [all the one-table verbs](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)

Other resources:

-   Like learning from a textbook? Check out all of [r4ds: transform](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html).
-   The [intro to `dplyr` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) is also a great resource.

Resources for specific concepts:

-   To learn more about window functions and how dplyr handles them, see the [window-functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) vignette for the `dplyr` package.

Participation
-------------

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the cm008-exercise.Rmd file ([Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/notes/cm008-exercise.Rmd), or [from html](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm008-exercise.nb.html)), and adding it to your participation repo.

Let's take time to get set up:

1.  Download the file as `.Rmd`.
2.  Move the file to your local participation repo.
3.  Open the `.Rmd` file, and change the output type to `github_document`.
4.  *Optional, but recommended*: Stage and commit the Rmd file (you can do this through RStudio).     - You can still get participation marks by uploading the final files to GitHub.
